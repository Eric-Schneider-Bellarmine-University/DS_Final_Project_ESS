Updated Repository with Project Proposal.

# 2/6/2024
Updated Repository with exploritory data analysis as well as the inital dataset for the first iteration of the predictive model.

# 3/5/2024
Updated repository with preliminary predictive models of KNearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Contemporary Gradient boosting, Histogram-based Gradient Boosting and Lasso Regression.

Dataset building program was also updated to remove outliers in the output of the model. A measure was taken to remove outliers for all ratios, but the difference between removing outliers in just the price change and all rows turned out to be immaterial, so it was best to only have the single row to remove outliers from the dataset in order to preserve computing time.
